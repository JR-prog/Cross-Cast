# CrossCast
Welcome to CrossCast!

This project was made as part of ConUHacksVII. The entire project was planned, developed, and deployed in 24 hours!

🏆 We are proud to announce that CrossCast was awarded first place in the Mirego sponsorship challenge!

## 🎨 Inspiration
We wanted every employee to stay up to date with their company's activities and be able to populate their own timeline with their unique qualities. In addition, our goal was to highlight the achievements of individual members of the team who are standing out across all teams. 

## 🔧 What it does
CrossCast compiles the most relevant content such as product releases (GitHub), popular community engagement (Slack), and even social media posts that reach the outside world (Twitter)!

## 🏗 How we built it
We built this by planning our architecture in such a way that we could easily simultaneously work on it. Each member worked on 1 of the 3 API's while the 4th built the UI for CrossCast. Using GET requests we were able to gather the information from each application and continuously provide up-to-date content without the use of databases.

## 🥊 Challenges we ran into
Slack API not being as intuitive or easy to use as GitHub or Twitter's. Getting JavaScript Dates() working. 
API tokens expiring halfway through the competition.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to integrate 3 different API's and deploy it with a stylish and coherent UI all in 24 hours. 

## 💭 What we learned
We learned that not all internal and social media platform API's are documented and made the same.
(Slack you could do better)

## 🔮 What's next for CrossCast
The future of CrossCast provides full integration support with all internal and social media platforms such as Jira, GitLab, Microsoft Teams, Jenkins, LinkedIn, etc.

✌ Thanks for stopping by!
